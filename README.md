## Libft

The Libft project is a fundamental part of 42, aimed at providing a strong foundation in C programming. This custom library includes a variety of essential C language functions designed to promote learning and practice of key concepts.
Implementation of basic functions: The library contains custom implementations of standard C functions, such as string manipulation, memory management, mathematical operations, and linked list manipulation.
Libft's functions serve as a foundation for future projects within the 42 curriculum. They provide a solid set of tools to tackle more advanced and complex tasks in subsequent projects.
In addition to basic functions, Libft includes the implementation of ft_printf for output formatting and get_next_line for efficient reading of lines from files or standard input. These functions have been integrated to enable their direct use from the Libft library.
